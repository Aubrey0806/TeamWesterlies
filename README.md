# Introduction to the Web App:
Due to climate change, the precipitation level in B.C. has been increasing in past years. This has resulted in multiple flooding events alongside of the Fraser river, and increasing the threat to populations who live there. Just in the past year in 2021, the city of Abbotsford has experienced the largest flooding event in decades, causing about $2 billion dollars in damages and leaving many injuries. Therefore, it is important for the home owners to know the risk levels of their home to future flooding events in Abbotsford, and how to safely evacuate during a flood. Furthermore, the officials will need to know the risk levels as well for developing a more sustainable city development plan.

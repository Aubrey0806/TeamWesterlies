## Introduction to the Web App:
Due to climate change, the precipitation level in B.C. has been increasing in past years. This has resulted in multiple flooding events alongside of the Fraser river, and increasing the threat to populations who live there. Just in the past year in 2021, the city of Abbotsford has experienced the largest flooding event in decades, causing about $2 billion dollars in damages and leaving many injuries. Therefore, it is important for the home owners to know the risk levels of their home to future flooding events in Abbotsford, and how to safely evacuate during a flood. Furthermore, the officials will need to know the risk levels as well for developing a more sustainable city development plan. 
## Mission Statement: 
Flooding refers to overflowing of water onto land that is normally dry due to heavy rains, sea level rises, snow melts and dams break (Alberta Water Portal Society, 2014). Floods are extremely destructive and will cause extreme physical damage to plants, animals, and communities. Furthermore,  floods can carry contaminants and viruses travel a long distance which might threaten drinking water safety. According to previous studies,  global warming effect lead to snowpack to melt and swell which increases the precipitation level and chances of floods.

Faster River basin located in B.C. is one of the largest river basins in Western Canada. The average temperature of Fraser River is 11Â°C, and the average monthly precipitation is around 66.5 mm (Timeanddate.com, 2021). The ongoing climate change have significantly increase the precipitation level in B.C. which result in higher frequency of flooding along Fraser River. 
Abbotsford experienced catastrophic flooding due to a heavy precipitation of 500mm in November, 2021. As a result, nearly 15,000 people were forced to leave their home, major roads and bridges were washed away, and farms were flooded with water up to two meters deep. Furthermore, the following landslides killed at least five people. Financial losses were estimated at $450 million includes 600,000 chickens and 12,000 pigs died (Weber, 2022).
